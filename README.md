# Data-Science-Assignment
This assignment requires students to develop a Town Recommendation System using data science techniques, specifically focusing on property prices, broadband speed, crime rates, and an additional factor in Bristol and Cornwall. Students must obtain and preprocess government-released datasets, analyze the data using exploratory and statistical methods, and create a simple recommendation system in R or Python. The report should include code snippets, visualizations, and an appendix with the full code. The work must be well-organized, with a strong emphasis on data cleaning, statistical analysis, system design, and ethical considerations, culminating in a 3000-word report. Marks are awarded based on data gathering, cleaning, analysis, statistical modeling, system design, and report quality, with adherence to APA referencing style.
